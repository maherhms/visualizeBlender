I am going to be developing useful blender plugins to improve user life quality and reduce simple redundant tasks.

## Camera_Object_Approach [Repository]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/maherhms/visualizeBlender/tree/main/Camera_Object_Approach))
> This plugin allows The camera to be animated to the selected object with depth of field. The animation length is set to 250 frames per default.

## MultiCam Auto Render Pro [Repository]([https://pages.github.com/]([https://github.com/maherhms/visualizeBlender/tree/main/MultiCam_Auto_Render_Pro))
> is a Blender addon designed to simplify the process of rendering scenes from multiple cameras. It allows Blender users to automatically render from each camera in a scene with a user-specified filename and directory, providing real-time progress updates and the ability to cancel rendering mid-process. This tool is ideal for projects requiring multiple angle captures without interrupting workflow.
