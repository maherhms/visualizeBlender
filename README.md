I am going to be developing useful blender plugins to improve user life quality and reduce simple redundant tasks.

## Camera_Object_Approach [Repository]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/maherhms/visualizeBlender/tree/main/Camera_Object_Approach))
> This plugin allows The camera to be animated to the selected object with depth of field. The animation length is set to 250 frames per default.
